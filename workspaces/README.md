# Workspaces

Workspaces are a Union feature which easily provision a VSCode server with the specified dependencies.
This can be especially useful when developing workflows or getting access to GPUs in an ephemeral way.

This directory contains a collection of workspace configs and potentially Dockerfiles supporting them.
They can be run with `unionai create workspace ws.yaml`. Please see the [docs](https://docs.union.ai/byoc/api/unionai-cli#unionai-create-workspace) for more information.
